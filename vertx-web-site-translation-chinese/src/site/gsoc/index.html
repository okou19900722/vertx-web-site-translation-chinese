        In 2018, the Eclipse Vert.x team proposes subjects for
        <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> through the Eclipse organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Project ideas are listed on the
        <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2018_Ideas#Eclipse_Vert.x">Eclipse Wiki page for GSoC</a>.
        If you are interested by one of these subjects, send an email to the possible mentor (link on the Eclipse wiki page).
      </p>
      <p>
        To submit your proposal, use the
        <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6364590460370944/"><strong>Eclipse</strong></a> organisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the GSoC proposal document, we ask candidates to
        <a href="https://github.com/tsegismont/vertx-gsoc-2018-qotd">implement a simple Vert.x application</a>.
        This helps us make sure candidates have a basic understanding of asynchronous programming and the Vert.x toolkit.
        <strong>Submit your proposal even if not done with the assessment application!</strong>
        Google will not extend the submission period but we can continue reviewing assessments while evaluating the submitted proposals.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have questions, feel free to ask possible mentors via email or on
        <a href="/community">community channels</a>.

      <h4>Vert.x-Web purely functional handlers</h4>
            <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
            <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Eclipse Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. Use any function as a vertx-web handler, then provide an API to compose
                these functions in a "RouterBuilder API" way. This should be a totally separated project, keeping vertx-web as is for now and targeting "pure JVM languages" (Java, Kotlin, Groovy, Scala), especially those who have "first-level" functions
                (and maybe annotations).</p>

            <strong>What should be achieved:</strong>

            <ul>
                <li>any lambda can now be used as a vert.x web handler, automatically resolving lambda parameters.</li>
                <li>provide the ability to deal with futures in vert.x-web, if a lambda is returning an AsyncResult, then:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the next handler should only be called once the future is completed.
                            <li>the context should automatically been failed if the asyncresult is failed.
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>allow users to define custom parameters resolvers by implementing an interface such as Resolvable&lt;RoutingContext, T&gt; or AsyncResolvable&lt;RoutingContext, T&gt;.</li>
                    <li>create a "builder-like" API on top of vertx-web's Router to deal with such lambdas.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For further reference and examples see the following <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vertx/01tCUjTm01s">google group post</a>.</p>

            <strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong> Java (8), Gradle or Maven is a plus<br/>

          <h4>Administration Console for Vert.x Applications</h4>
            <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
            <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Eclipse Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. This topic is about implementing an extensible administration console.</p>
            <p>The outcome should be able to be consumed as a Vert.x Web Handler, but also as guidelines to build such extensible dashboards.</p>

            <strong>What should be achieved (non exhaustive list):</strong>

            <ul>
                <li>Scaffolding the dashboard</li>
                <li>Provide a view of the application content</li>
                <li>Provide a logger view to get and set the log levels</li>
                <li>Add a basic monitoring view</li>
                <li>Add a service discovery view</li>
                <li>Add a circuit breaker view</li>
                <li>Add a CRUD view</li>
            </ul>

          <h4>Vert.x on Embedded JDK</h4>
            <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
            <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Eclipse Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. More and more Vert.x is getting used on IoT fields now that we offer
                support for MQTT and are lightweight when compared to other Java frameworks. It is important that Vert.x applications can run as expected under the embedded JDK using the compact profiles (<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/161">JEP-161</a>).
            </p>

            <strong>What should be achieved:</strong>

            <ul>
                <li>Document how to work with Embedded JDK:
                    <ul>
                        <li>How to build and Vert.x application with a compact profile.</li>
                        <li>Identify if there are required changes to the core platform to cover this feature.</li>
                        <li>Write articles on this subject.</li>
                        <li>Work with the IoT community to identify usability issues and provide solutions.</li>
                    </ul>

          <h4>Implementation of “blueprint” Vert.x applications</h4>
            <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
            <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. The idea of the project is to implement a set of applications using the Vert.x
                toolkit to illustrate how different classes of applications can be done. This project aims to provide guidelines to Vert.x users to implement various applications.</p>
            <p>The project starts with an introduction to Vert.x and the implementation of small examples using the different modules available in the Vert.x ecosystem. Then, the first application is a web application to manage a todo list following the
                specifications of <a href="http://www.todobackend.com/">Todo Backend</a>. The second application is a message-based application such as <a href="http://automattic.github.io/kue/">Kue</a>. The third application is also message-based but
                illustrates the scalability of Vert.x. It provides a message processing system able to handle a large number of message per seconds. Finally, the last application is a micro-service application close to the <a href="https://github.com/kbastani/spring-cloud-microservice-example">Spring Micro Service example</a>.</p>
            <p>Live demo of the applications will run on OpenShift and OpenStack, to illustrate production deployment. All these applications will be available and documented on the Vert.x website.</p>

          <h4>Event bus clients for C, Objective-C, and Rust applications</h4>
            <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
            <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. Thanks to its eventbus, any application can interact with Vert.x applications.
                The idea of the project is to provide a set of libraries to ease the integration of Vert.x applications with applications developed in Go, Rust and C.</p>
            <p>The project starts with an introduction to Vert.x and the implementation of small examples using the different modules available in the Vert.x ecosystem. A focus is made on the integration capabilities and the event bus bridges.</p>
            <p>At least 3 languages are covered in this project: C, Objective-C and Rust. Proposals for other languages are definitely welcome. For each language, a library is developed in order to let an application developed with the language to interact
                with the Vert.x Event Bus. The communication is based on TCP and JSON.</p>
