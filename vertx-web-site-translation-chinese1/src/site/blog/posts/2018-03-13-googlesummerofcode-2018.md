It's this time of year again!
[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2018 submission period has just started!

## Submit through the Eclipse organization

This year, the Eclipse Vert.x project participates through the [Eclipse organization](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6364590460370944/).
Make sure to review our [GSoC 2018 ideas](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2018_Ideas#Eclipse_Vert.x) and to submit before March, 27!

## Assessment application

As we did before, we ask candidates to [implement a simple Vert.x application](https://github.com/tsegismont/vertx-gsoc-2018-qotd).
This helps us make sure candidates have a basic understanding of asynchronous programming and the Vert.x toolkit.
**But submit your proposal even if not done with the assessment application!**
Google will not extend the submission period but we can continue reviewing assessments while evaluating the submitted proposals.

## Questions?

If you have questions, feel free to ask possible mentors via email or on our [community channels](/community).

All the details for this year (and ideas from past years) can be found on the [Vert.x GSoC page](/gsoc).

Looking forward to your proposals!
