[Vert.x Web](http://vertx.io/docs/#web) distinguishes itself from traditional application servers like JavaEE by just
being a simple extension toolkit to [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/docs/#core), which makes it quite lightweight and small but
nevertheless very powerful.

One can create simple applications targeting _small_ devices such as Raspberry Pi without having to write much code but
still very fast as it is expected from any Vert.x application.

Let's for example think of making a [realtime cpu load visualization web app](https://github.com/pmlopes/vert-x3-experiments/archive/experiments/rpi-cpuload.zip).
For this example we need a few things:

* a [MXBean](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/management/OperatingSystemMXBean.html) to collect CPU load
* a [HTTP server](http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_writing_http_servers_and_clients) (to serve the static resources and host our app)
* a [SockJS server](http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/#_sockjs) to provide realtime updates
* a SockJS to [EventBus bridge](http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/#_sockjs_event_bus_bridge) to pass messages around
* some [visualization](http://d3js.org/) JS library
* a bit of coding

To bootstrap this project we start by creating the [pom.xml](https://github.com/pmlopes/vert-x3-experiments/blob/experiments/rpi-cpuload/pom.xml)
file. A good start is always to consult the [examples](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples),
and you should end up with something like:

```xml
...
<groupId>io.vertx.blog</groupId>
<artifactId>rpi</artifactId>
<version>1.0</version>

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
    <artifactId>vertx-core</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
  </dependency>

  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
    <artifactId>vertx-web</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
...
```

At this moment you can start coding the application using the standard maven source `src/main/java` and resource
`src/main/resouces` locations. And add a the class [io.vertx.blog.RpiVerticle](https://github.com/pmlopes/vert-x3-experiments/blob/experiments/rpi-cpuload/src/main/java/io/vertx/blog/RPiVerticle.java)
to the project:

```java
public class RPiVerticle extends AbstractVerticle {

  private static final OperatingSystemMXBean osMBean;

  static {
    try {
      osMBean = ManagementFactory.newPlatformMXBeanProxy(ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer(),
          ManagementFactory.OPERATING_SYSTEM_MXBEAN_NAME, OperatingSystemMXBean.class);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
  }

  @Override
  public void start() {

    Router router = Router.router(vertx);

    router.route("/eventbus/*").handler(SockJSHandler.create(vertx)
        .bridge(new BridgeOptions().addOutboundPermitted(new PermittedOptions().setAddress("load"))));

    router.route().handler(StaticHandler.create());

    vertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(router::accept).listen(8080);

    vertx.setPeriodic(1000, t -> vertx.eventBus().publish("load",
        new JsonObject()
            .put("creatTime", System.currentTimeMillis())
            .put("cpuTime", osMBean.getSystemLoadAverage())));
  }
}
```

So let's go through the code, first in the static constructor we initialize the `MXBean` that will allow us to collect
the current `System Load Average`, then on the `start` method we create a `Vert.x Web Router` and define that for all
requests starting with `/eventbus` should be handled by the SockJS server, which we then bridge to the Vert.x
`EventBus` and allow outbound messages addressed to the `load` address.

Since our application is a web application we will also server some static content with the `StaticHandler` and we
finally start a `HTTP server` listening on port `8080`.

So now all we are missing is a way to push real time data to the client so we end up creating a `Periodic` task that
repeats every 1000 milliseconds and sends some `JSON` payload to the address `"load"`.

If you run this application right now you won't see much since there is no frontend yet, so let's build a very basic
[index.html](https://github.com/pmlopes/vert-x3-experiments/blob/experiments/rpi-cpuload/src/main/resources/webroot/index.html):

```javascript
...
var eb = new vertx.EventBus(window.location + "eventbus");

eb.onopen = function () {
  eb.registerHandler("load", function (msg) {
    if (data.length === 25) {
      // when length of data equal 25 then pop data[0]
      data.shift();
    }
    data.push({
      "creatTime": new Date(msg.creatTime),
      "cpuTime": msg.cpuTime
    });
    render();
  });
};
...
```

Let's walk again the code, we start by opening a `EventBus` bridge over `SockJS` and register a handler `data` to consume
messages sent to that address. Once such a message arrives we do some house keeping to avoid filling our browser memory
and then add the incoming message to the data queue and triger a rendering of the data. There is however one interesting
issue here, since the message payload is `JSON` there is no native support for `Date` objects so we need to do some
parsing from what arrives from the server. In this case the server sends a simple time since epoch number, but one can
choose any format he likes.

At this moment you can build and package your app like `mvn clean package`, then deploy it to your raspberrypi like:
`scp target/rpi-1.0-fat.jar pi@raspberrypi:~/` and finally run it: `java -jar rpi-1.0-fat.jar`.

Open a browser to [see](http://raspberrypi:8080) the realtime graph!
